### Making your Drupal website into a chatbot.
--- 
DrupalGPT is a module that enables you to add a chatbot onto any page you desire.

DrupalGPT will eventually be allowed to have category specific settings to give optimized feedback to the user. In the future you will be able to provide it with documents specific to that category you choose.

For example, lets say you run an education website and have a department called Elementary Education. Through the Admin UI you will be able to upload documents, pdfs, or plain text that will then be served to the chatbot when answering a question related to the information provided.

DrupalGPT is the ultimate solution for making your website more engaging, conversational, and user-friendly. With DrupalGPT, you can turn your website into a chatbot that speaks your brand’s voice and meets your customers’ needs.
